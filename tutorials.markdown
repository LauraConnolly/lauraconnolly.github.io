# ISMR 2023 Tutorial - SlicerROS2 (April 19, 2023)

See [ISMR 2023 Workshop page](/ismr2023/index)




# ISMR 2021 Tutorial - Integration of Slicer and ROS2 using ros2_igtl_bridge (2021)
In this tutorial, the participants will build a system for image-guided robot-assisted interventions on their own laptop computers using state-of-the-art research platforms for medical imaging and robotics, namely 3D Slicer 4.13 and Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). The two platforms will be integrated using an open network communication protocol, OpenIGTLink. Then the participant will build a demo system that allows a user to plan a procedure on a 3D image using AI-based segmentation, execute the plan using a virtual robot, and visualize the 3D model of the robot along with reformatted images of the patient as feedback. At the end of the tutorial, the participants are expected to have a working demo system on their laptops, which could potentially be used as a template for their own research project.
