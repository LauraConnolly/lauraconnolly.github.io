Setting Up ROS2 and 3D Slicer Environment on Ubuntu 22.04
=========================================================

ROS2 Humble
-----------
To install the base ROS2 package, please follow [the ROS2 Humble Installation page](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html).


SlicerROS2
----------
While 3D Slicer is distributed in both source and binary packages, we need to use the source package and build on the ROS2 system to use the SlicerROS2 extension. The instruction to build 3D Slicer and SlicerROS2 can be found on [the SlicerROS2 instruction page](https://slicer-ros2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/getting-started.html).
