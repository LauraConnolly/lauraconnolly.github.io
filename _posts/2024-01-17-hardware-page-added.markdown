We've added a new Hardware page to our website, showcasing various hardware platforms and components that can be integrated with our software tools for medical robotics research and development.

The page provides information about compatible robots, sensors, and custom hardware setups that have been successfully used with SlicerROS2 and our other software components for image-guided interventions.
