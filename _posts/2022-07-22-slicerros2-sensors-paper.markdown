Our paper "Bridging 3D Slicer and ROS2 for Image-Guided Robotic Interventions" has been published in the journal Sensors. The paper describes how SlicerROS2 connects 3D Slicer, a medical image computing platform, with ROS2, a robotic middleware, to facilitate the development of image-guided robotic intervention systems.

The integration enables seamless communication between medical imaging software and robotic hardware, supporting applications in surgical planning, navigation, and intervention. The module provides a framework for rapid prototyping and testing of new image-guided robotic systems.
