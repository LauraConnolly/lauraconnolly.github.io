We are pleased to announce the publication of our paper "SlicerROS2: A Research and Development Module for Image-Guided Robotic Interventions" in IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics.

This paper details the SlicerROS2 module, which facilitates the integration of 3D Slicer with hardware and software supported by ROS2, enabling rapid prototyping of image-guided robotic intervention systems. The module bridges the gap between medical imaging platforms and robotic systems, supporting the development of advanced interventional techniques.
