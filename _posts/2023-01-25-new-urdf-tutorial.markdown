We've added a new tutorial on exporting URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files from CAD software for robot visualization in ROS and 3D Slicer. This tutorial walks through the process of converting CAD models to URDF format, visualizing robots in RViz, and integrating with 3D Slicer using SlicerROS2.

The tutorial includes screenshots and step-by-step instructions to help researchers and developers create accurate visual representations of their robotic systems for simulation and testing.
