We are excited to announce our upcoming workshop "Open-Source Software for Intelligent Image-Guided Medical Robots" at ISMR 2025, scheduled for May 14, 2025.

This workshop will focus on open-source platforms for AI-driven medical robotics, featuring presentations and hands-on sessions demonstrating the interoperability between 3D Slicer, ROS2, AMBF, Gazebo, and the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Participants will learn about tools for training and deploying AI models for surgical robotic systems and experience demonstrations of integrated clinical applications.
